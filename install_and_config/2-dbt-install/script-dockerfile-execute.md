##### Types of Docker Images 
- **Bookworm** refers to the codename for the latest stable release of Debian.
- **Slim** indicates a minimal version of a Debian distribution with only the essential packages installed
- **Bullseye** is the codename for the previous stable Debian release
- **Alpine** is the “Dockerized” version of Alpine Linux


##### Create Containers using Dockerfile
- **Dockerfile -** 
It is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It is used to create a Docker image from a Dockerfile. 
**Dockerfile Reference** - "dbt-learn-hands-on/install_and_config/2-dbt-install/Dockerfile" 
    - **FROM** - specifies the base image to use for the new image. In this case, python :3.12-slim is used as the base image
    - **WORKDIR** - sets the working directory in the container to /usr/local/app
    - **COPY** - copies files from the current directory into the container at the specified path
    - **RUN** - executes a command in the container. In this case, it installs the python packages mentioned in the requirements.txt file
    - **CMD** - specifies the default command to run when the container is started. In this case, CMD ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"] is used to keep the container running indefinitely.
    - **Volume** - Specify the container path which will be mapped to the host machine path. In this case, the /usr/local/app directory is used.

- **Scripts -** 
  - Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the Dockerfile is located.
  - Run the command `docker build -v "<host/folder : docker/folder>" -t <image-name> .` to build the Docker image
    - **docker build**: This is the command to initiate the image building process
    - **-t <image_name>**: This flag is used to tag the image with a name. This makes it easier to identify and reference the image later.
    - **.** : This indicates that the Dockerfile is located in the current directory.
    
    ``` 
    # Build dockerfile to create a new image
    docker build -t dbt-learn-hands-on .
    ```
  - Run the command `docker run -it --rm -v "<host/folder : docker/folder >" --name <container-name> <image-name>` to create and run a new container from the Docker image
    - **docker run**: This command is used to create a new container from the Docker image
    - **-it**: This flag is used to allocate a pseudo-TTY to the container and keep the container running even after the command is executed
    - **--rm**: This flag is used to automatically remove the container when it is stopped 
    - **-v "<host/folder : docker/folder>"**: This flag is used to mount a volume from the host machine to the container. This allows the container to access files from the 
    - **--name <container-name>**: This flag is used to specify the name of the container
    - **<image_name>** : This is the name of the Docker image created in the previous step

    ```
    # Run the container from the newly created image and mount the volume with host folder
    # while using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), path should be in the format /mnt/c/path/to/folder
    # Syntax : docker run -it --rm -v "/mnt/c/path/to/folder:/usr/local/app" --name dbt-learn-hands-on dbt-learn-hands-on

    docker run -v /mnt/c/Users/jerin/OneDrive\ -\ Aligned\ Automation/Work/Learn/Tech\ Solutions/dbt-learn-hands-on/main/dbt-working-folder:/usr/local/app/dbt-working-folder --name dbt-learn-hands-on dbt-learn-hands-on
    ``` 
  - Start the shell of running container in Host machine using the following command
    ```
    docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> /bin/bash
    ```
